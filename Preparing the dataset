Preparing the dataset

Before anaylysis, I leveraged Excel to ensure there weren't any cells that could've cause potential inaccurcies
or errors when querying in SQL. Just to be even more sure I queryed the data set to ensure there werent any NULL values.
This dataset is mainly nutrtioanl components which means if there were blanks cells they'd have to be reviewed to in order
to input the correct value of the nutrtional component.

-- Checking my dataset for null values

--Check for any NULL values
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM McDonaldsNutritionAnalysis.dbo.Md_Nutrition
WHERE Category IS NULL OR Item IS NULL OR Serving_Size IS NULL OR Calories IS NULL OR Calories_from_Fat IS NULL OR Total_fat IS NULL OR Total_Fat_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Saturated_Fat IS NULL
OR Saturated_Fat_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Trans_Fat IS NULL OR Cholesterol IS NULL OR Cholesterol_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Sodium IS NULL OR Sodium_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Carbohydrates IS NULL OR Carbohydrates_Daily_Percentage IS NULL 
OR [Dietary Fiber] IS NULL OR Dietary_Fiber_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Sugars IS NULL OR Protein IS NULL OR Vitamin_A_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Vitamin_C_Daily_Percentage IS NULL
OR Calcium_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Iron_Daily_Percentage IS NULL;

Result:

null_count
0
