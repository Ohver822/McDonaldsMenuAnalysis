Preparing the dataset

Before anaylysis, I leveraged Excel to review the data and ensure there weren't any cells that could cause potential inaccurcies
or errors when querying in SQL. Just to be 100% certain, I queryed the data set to ensure there weren't NULL values.
This dataset is mainly nutrtioanl components which means if there were blank or null values they'd have to be reviewed to in order
and inputted manually before this analysis.

Checking my dataset for null values

--Check for any NULL values
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM McDonaldsNutritionAnalysis.dbo.Md_Nutrition
WHERE Category IS NULL OR Item IS NULL OR Serving_Size IS NULL OR Calories IS NULL OR Calories_from_Fat IS NULL OR Total_fat IS NULL OR Total_Fat_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Saturated_Fat IS NULL
OR Saturated_Fat_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Trans_Fat IS NULL OR Cholesterol IS NULL OR Cholesterol_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Sodium IS NULL OR Sodium_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Carbohydrates IS NULL OR Carbohydrates_Daily_Percentage IS NULL 
OR [Dietary Fiber] IS NULL OR Dietary_Fiber_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Sugars IS NULL OR Protein IS NULL OR Vitamin_A_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Vitamin_C_Daily_Percentage IS NULL
OR Calcium_Daily_Percentage IS NULL OR Iron_Daily_Percentage IS NULL;

Result:
null_count
0

Recategorizing the dataset.

This dataset originally was grouped into 9 categories; Breakfast, Beef & Pork, Chicken & Fish, Salads, Snacks & Sides, Desserts, Coffee & Tea,
Smoothies & Shakes, and Beverages. I decided to recategorize the data into four categories to analyze the data based on the time of day these meals were being consumed. Firstly,
I created a parent column for these categories to be stored in, and I assigned all Breakfast items to remaing as breakfast.
The categories Beef & Pork, Chicken & Fish, and Salads were assigned to Lunch & Dinner. Smoothies & Shakes and Coffee & Tea were reassigned 
to the beverages category to be analyzed as a whole.

--Add a parent column to categorize food items into four categories

ALTER TABLE McDonaldsNutritionAnalysis.dbo.Md_Nutrition
ADD [Meal_Type] VARCHAR(255);

--Update the four categories
UPDATE McDonaldsNutritionAnalysis.dbo.Md_Nutrition
SET [Meal_Type] = 
    CASE 
        WHEN [Category] = 'Breakfast' THEN 'Breakfast'
        WHEN [Category] = 'Beef & Pork' THEN 'Lunch & Dinner'
		WHEN [Category] = 'Chicken & Fish' THEN 'Lunch & Dinner'
		WHEN [Category] = 'Salads' THEN 'Lunch & Dinner'
		WHEN [Category] = 'Snacks & Sides' THEN 'Snacks & Desserts'
		WHEN [Category] = 'Desserts' THEN 'Snacks & Desserts'
		WHEN [Category] = 'Smoothies & Shakes' THEN 'Beverages'
    WHEN [Category] = 'Coffee & Tea' THEN 'Beverages'
    WHEN [Category] = 'Beverages' THEN 'Beverages'
        ELSE 'Unknown' -- Default value if 'Category' doesn't match any of the cases
    END;

Result:
(260 rows affected)
