And the analysis begins!!!

Questions to answer:

1. How many items are in this dataset? How many items are there per category?

SELECT Meal_type, COUNT(ITEM) as item_count
FROM McDonaldsNutritionAnalysis.dbo.Md_Nutrition
GROUP BY Meal_type

Result: 

Meal_type	item_count
Beverages:	150
Breakfast: 42
Lunch & Dinner:	48
Snacks & Desserts:	20

Total of 260 items on the menu.

2. What are the average, minimum, and maximum values of the the nutritional components from the menu?

Side Note: These values were pivotted and took up numerous lines of code, I will be posting my file, 
for review on a seperate file. For visibility purposes I will not be posting the pivot code on here.
