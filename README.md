# Analyzing Nutritional Components of McDonald's Menu: Identifying the Healthiest Options

The objective of this data analysis project is to comprehensively evaluate the nutritional components of McDonald's menu items with the primary goal of identifying and highlighting the healthiest options available. McDonald's is one of the largest and most popular fast-food chains globally, and understanding the nutritional profile of its menu items can provide valuable insights for both consumers and the company itself in promoting healthier food choices.

To start off this analysis, I want to start by pivotting the nutritional componenets for the average, min, and max values per category.
