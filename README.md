# Analyzing Nutritional Components of McDonald's Menu: Identifying the Healthiest Options

The objective of this data analysis project is to comprehensively evaluate the nutritional components of McDonald's menu items with the primary goal of identifying and highlighting the healthiest options available. McDonald's is one of the largest and most popular fast-food chains globally, and understanding the nutritional profile of its menu items can provide valuable insights for both consumers and the company itself in promoting healthier food choices.

To commence this analysis, my first task is to identify the nutritional components and determine their Average, Minimum, and Maximum values in order to spot outliers among these three metrics.

Clearly, among all the food categories, 'Lunch & Dinner' stands out as the one with the highest calorie count, boasting an impressive 1,880 calories for one of my McDonald's food items.

Lets identify the top 5 items with the highest calories from this dataset.
