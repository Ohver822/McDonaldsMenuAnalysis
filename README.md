# Analyzing Nutritional Components of McDonald's Menu: Identifying the Healthiest Options

The objective of this data analysis project is to comprehensively evaluate the nutritional components of McDonald's menu items with the primary goal of identifying and highlighting the healthiest options available. McDonald's is one of the largest and most popular fast-food chains globally, and understanding the nutritional profile of its menu items can provide valuable insights for both consumers and the company itself in promoting healthier food choices.


## Analysis of the Average, Minimum and Max values per category

To commence this analysis, my first task is to identify the nutritional components and determine their Average, Minimum, and Maximum values in order to spot outliers among these three metrics.

Clearly, among all the food categories, 'Lunch & Dinner' stands out as the one with the highest calorie count, boasting an impressive 1,880 calories for one of my McDonald's food items. Another outlier of the category with the lowest calorie count lies in the 'Snacks & Desserts' category with light 15 calorie food item (water not included).

**Insight from visual:**
Apple Slices stand out as the menu's most calorie-friendly option, containing just 15 calories, while the Chicken McNuggets (40-piece) top the list with the highest calorie content. This information is valuable for individuals striving to maintain a balanced diet as well as those seeking to increase their calorie intake.
