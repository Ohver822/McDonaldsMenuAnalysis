# Analyzing Nutritional Components of McDonald's Menu: Identifying the Healthiest Options

The objective of this data analysis project is to comprehensively evaluate the nutritional components of McDonald's menu items with the primary goal of identifying and highlighting the healthiest options available. McDonald's is one of the largest and most popular fast-food chains globally, and understanding the nutritional profile of its menu items can provide valuable insights for both consumers and the company itself in promoting healthier food choices.

To start off this analysis, I need to indentify the nutritional components and there Average, Min and Max values to identify outliers across the three values

As we can see, the food category, with the highest calories is 'Lunch & Dinner' with outstanding number of 1,880 calories for one of my McDonald's food items.

Lets identify the top 5 items with the highest calories from this dataset.
